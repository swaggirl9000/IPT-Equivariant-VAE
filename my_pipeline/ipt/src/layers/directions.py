    Provides a structured set of directions in two dimensions. First the
    interval [0,2*pi] is devided into a regular grid and the corresponding

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_thetas: int
        The number of directions to generate.

    Returns
    ----------
    v: Tensor
        Tensor of shape [2,num_thetas] containing the directions where each
        column is one direction in 2D.
        The directions start at $theta=0$ and runs to $theta = 2 * pi$.

    Generate randomly sampled directions from a sphere in d dimensions.

    First a standard gaussian centered at 0 with standard deviation 1 is sampled
    and then projected onto the unit sphere. This yields a uniformly sampled set
    of points on the unit spere. Please note that the generated shapes with have
    shape [d, num_thetas].

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_thetas: int
        The number of directions to generate.
    d: int
        The dimension of the unit sphere. Default is 3 (hence R^3)
